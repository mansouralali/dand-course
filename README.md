A data analysis on the Titanic Dataset which is provided by Udacity

In this analysis of the Titanic data, one of the major questions that arises is How many factors affected a person's survival rate? Using the provided data, this question was broken down into further branches. A) Did individual characteristics played any role in the survival rate?

Age
Gender
Adult or child
Passenger Class B) Which was the location a passenger embarked from? And is there a relation between the embarkment location and the class in which the passenger resided? Perhaps that may tell us something about that place's socio economic condition. C) Did the survival rate depend on whether the person was travelling alone or with family?
